        As long as I can remember I have been drawn to combining technology and
        design. The infinite potential has always fascinated me and I have never
        been afraid to just jump in and give it a go, whether it is Microsoft
        Paint, HTML/CSS, blogging, World of Worldcraft or Photoshop.
        Unfortunately for me, I always considered these as mere hobbies.

        Fast forward to 2021 and I decided to step away from my optometrist
        career and pursue my long-lasting yearning of a technology and design
        based occupation. As I am finishing up the front-end development
        education at Noroff, I am thrilled to finally be able to create, design
        and maintain user-friendly concepts that solves real problems and has a
        purpose.
